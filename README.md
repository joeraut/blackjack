###About
This is a one-player blackjack game, where the player plays against the dealer.

###Gameplay
The player sets an initial balance, deals and then hits or stands until either getting a blackjack, winning, losing or pushing.
When out of money the option to top up or end the game is given.

###How to Build
This project was developed in Eclipse, so it's easy to just import the project directly into Eclipse and run.
Otherwise, simply compile the .java sources in `src`, and be sure to include the image resources in the repo root.
